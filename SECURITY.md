Your report will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your report within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your submission.

We request that you not publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed by our team. Details of the security issue will be shared after the issue has been resolved.

## Security Update Policy

Security updates will be released as patches to the current version and as minor updates to all supported versions. We will provide detailed release notes for each security update.

## Public Disclosure Timing

The timing of the public disclosure will be negotiated with the reporter. We prefer to fully disclose the issue as soon as possible after the vulnerability has been fixed, but understand the need to delay disclosure to protect users.
